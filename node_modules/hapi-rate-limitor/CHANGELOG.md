# Changelog


## [3.1.1](https://github.com/futurestudio/hapi-rate-limitor/compare/v3.1.0...v3.1.1) - 2020-08-05

### Updated
- bump dependencies
- minor code refinements
- replaced `request-ip` dependency with `@supercharge/request-ip` providing improved request IP detection


## [3.1.0](https://github.com/futurestudio/hapi-rate-limitor/compare/v3.0.0...v3.1.0) - 2020-06-01

### Updated
- refined route-specific rate limit handling
- bump dependencies

### Possible Breaking Changes
This release introduces an updated handling route-level max attempts.

**Previously**, the default (server-wide) rate limit affected route-level rate limits.
**Now**, the route-level rate limits are independend and not affected by the default rate limit.

Example: you have a `/login` route with `{ max: 10 }` configuration and your default configuration is `{ max: 60 }`. In the previous version, any request to other pages than `/login` would affect the max limit of 10 requests for the `/login` route. This behavior may have eaten all 10 requests already before even visiting the `/login` route. This new version handles the `/login` route independently from other pages because it has its own `max` configuration.

This changed handling may introduce a breaking change for your app if you previously worked around that issue. Sorry, if Iâ€™m causing you trouble. Iâ€™m releasing this version as a minor release in the `2.x` and `3.x` release lines. In case youâ€™re using tilde (`~`) in your `package.json` file, youâ€™re not directly updated to this version when running `npm install`.

### Added
- `getIp` option allowing you to manually determine the IP address from the request.
  - Example:
    ```js
    await server.register({
      plugin: require('hapi-rate-limitor'),
      options: {
        getIp: async (request) => {
          const ips = request.headers['x-forwarded-for'].split(',')

          return ips[ips.length - 1]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
- `emitter` option to pass in your custom event emitter
- dispatch rate limiting events: `rate-limit:attempt`, `rate-limit:in-quota`, `rate-limit:exceeded`
  - every event listener receives the request as the only argument
